# WanderLust
This is a static UI design of the travel website named "WanderLust". 
The purpose of this project was to design and develop user-centered interfaces by implementing Jakob Neilson’s ten usability heuristics and Shneiderman’s eight golden rules of interface design. Thus, emphasis has been given to making the interfaces look user-friendly and visually appealing. Usability and accessibility testing have also been performed after the completion of the development.
